The human body breaks down food into molecules and electrolytes which become refined and processed into grey matter within the brain. In seperate lobes of the brain, chemicals are stored that when mixed, create explosive, combustion reactions with shock waves that travel through our nervous system into our muscles. The process of regulating levels of chemical combustion to achieve the desired force within target muscle groups is under-investigated by modern medicine and science. The consciousness behind the decisions to use our muscle groups is investigated in Symphorea of Conciouss. This investigation looks at how our Conciouss actually moves mass via highly controlled micro exothermic explosions in the brain. 

Step 1: find where the nerve channels begin. 

Where nerves end is in muscles and tissue, where they begin is where we will find exothermic chemical explosions within the brain.

Step 2: Find which areas of the brain are feeding reactive reagents into the nerve bases.

Step 3: Determine which reactive reagents are being produced and stored in the brain.

Step 4: Determine how the body produces these reagents efficiently from daily food intake.

Step 5: Reproduce this process for use in producing electricity from food waste as a method of creating renewable energy from recycling.
