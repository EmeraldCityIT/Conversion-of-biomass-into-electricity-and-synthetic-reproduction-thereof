The human body breaks down food into molecules and electrolytes which become refined and processed into grey matter within the brain. In seperate lobes of the brain, chemicals are stored that when mixed, create explosive, combustion reactions with shock waves that travel through our nervous system into our muscles. The process of regulating levels of chemical combustion to achieve the desired force within target muscle groups is under-investigated by modern medicine and science. The consciousness behind the decisions to use our muscle groups is investigated in Symphorea of Conciouss
